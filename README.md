Introdunction:
--------------------------
batch_unrar.sh is a shell script that unrar the given rar file and activate wash.py. The unrar function comes from unrar.sh, and our batch_unrar.sh takes start_date and end_date parameters (to be modified directly in the script file.)

wash.py washes the data and generates a summary csv file.

Our rar file, put in the same folder as the scripts, contains an amount of csv files whose names contain date information in yyyymmdd format.

data_structure.txt shows data structure in each of csv file.

The two test .sh files are test versions that generates washed csv for 20200803 under relative directory in wash_and_rar
